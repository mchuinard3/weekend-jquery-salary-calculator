# **Salary Calculator Weekend Challenge Project**

## **Description**

```
The Salary Calculator allows businesses to determine the monthly cost of the yearly salaries of their employees. It works by the employee information being entered in as follows: 

- employee first name
- employee last name
- employee ID#
- employee job title
- employee annual salary

Once these fields are entered, you click on the *submit* button, and the fields will show up in the table. As employees are added, the table is designed to display the overall monthly cost of each employee that has been entered into the table. If the overall monthly cost from the table exceeds $20,000, it will turn red. Any employee that is entered into the table can also be removed by simply clicking the *delete* button.
